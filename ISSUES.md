## Issues

- [x] Should only send to the correct tab - currently webRequest broadcasts to all active tabs
- [x] Make Adobe data more readable - eVars and props, instead of truncated keys.
- [ ] Refactor/decompose the background_helpers.js
- [ ] Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `Table`.
